                <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about how to
                    get the right
                    word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma plugin for the
                    larger design
                    community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and
                    categorized with a voice and
                    tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin
                    originated from our
                    Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for error messages.

                    Step 2: Open the plugin on your artboard
                    Step 3: Search for your copy or look through the different categories of the copies
                    Step 4: Select the type of error you are looking for. You will get three different copies for each
                    error
                    Step 5: Tap on the cards to insert text in your frames
                    And you are all geared up to make your UX copies more fun and exciting ðŸ˜Ž
